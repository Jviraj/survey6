# survey6
ipv6 survey Tool (survey6)
#### Brief explanation:  
Ipv6 is the internet's future, and it necessitated a more scalable survey tool to comprehend how routing and DNS function. The purpose of this project is to create an IPv6 listener that will passively collect IPv6 traffic data as a passive data collection tool for cyber security research.
#### Expected results: 
* Develop a Linux network probe to intercept ipv6 traffic 
* To centralize the data being intercepted by the probe, develop a geo-distributed grid application that integrated with the probe. 
#### Knowledge Prerequisite:  
* C++
* Linux
